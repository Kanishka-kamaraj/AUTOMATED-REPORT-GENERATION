*DESCRIPTION*: 

AUTOMATED PDF REPORT GENERATION USING PYTHON :

This project is a simple yet practical implementation of an Automated PDF Report Generator built using Python. It reads data from a CSV file, performs basic analysis, creates a visual chart, and finally generates a clean, professional PDF report — all in a single run.

OBJECTIVE :

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how Python can automate routine reporting tasks that are often done manually. It helps reduce time and human error by programmatically producing structured reports from raw data. This can be especially useful for internal business reports, performance summaries, and departmental overviews.

FEATURES :

1.Reads data from a CSV file
The script reads structured data from a file named data.csv. In this case, the data represents various departments, their employee count, and monthly budgets.

2.Performs data analysis using Pandas
It calculates basic statistics such as count, mean, min, max, and percentiles using the describe() method in pandas.

3.Generates a bar chart using Matplotlib
A visual representation of the budget for each department is created and saved as an image.

4.Creates a PDF report using FPDF
The final report includes a title, tabular data from the CSV, and the generated chart — all neatly formatted and exported as a PDF file.

5.Cleans up temporary files
The chart image used in the PDF is deleted after the report is generated to keep the project folder clean.
